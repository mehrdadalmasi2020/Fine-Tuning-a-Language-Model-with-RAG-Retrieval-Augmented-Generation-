🚀 Fine-Tuning a Language Model with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a language model using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), leveraging Hugging Face's transformers library. The process follows these key steps:

🛠️ System Setup
✅ Checks the GPU availability using nvidia-smi to ensure compatibility for model training.
📥 Loading the Pretrained Model
Uses the Flan-T5 model from the Hugging Face Hub.
Loads the tokenizer to process input text efficiently.
📚 Preparing the Dataset
Loads the SQuAD v2 dataset.
✅ Filters out examples with empty answers to improve training quality.
✅ Shuffles & selects a subset for memory-efficient training.
🎯 Fine-Tuning the Model
✅ Trains the model using structured prompts optimized for FLAN-T5.
✅ Applies gradient checkpointing and BF16 precision to enhance memory efficiency.
✅ Configures custom training arguments, including:
Learning rate: 3e-5
Epochs: 5
Batch size: 2
Gradient accumulation for better memory management.
📊 Model Evaluation
✅ Evaluates model performance on a held-out validation set.
✅ Reports final evaluation loss to measure improvements.
💾 Saving the Fine-Tuned Model
✅ Saves the trained model weights, tokenizer, and configuration.
✅ Outputs a fully trained model ready for inference & deployment.
🔍 Testing the Model
✅ Runs test queries from the training set.
✅ Displays:
